Excited to share my latest project where I built an Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to track key business insights!

ðŸ”¹ Highlights from the dashboard:

âœ… YTD Sales: $2.18M

âœ… QTD Sales: $811K

âœ… Products Sold (YTD): 27.7K

âœ… Reviews (YTD): 19.4M

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

ðŸ“Œ Trend analysis of sales by month & week

ðŸ“Œ Drill-down by product category & product description

ðŸ“Œ Performance tracking with Top 5 products by Sales & Reviews

ðŸ“Œ Interactive filters by Category & Quarter

ðŸ“Œ Data model built with Calendar Table for accurate time intelligence

This project really demonstrates the power of data storytelling â€“ turning raw Amazon data into actionable insights for better decision-making.

ðŸ’¡ Power BI is not just about visuals, itâ€™s about enabling businesses to understand trends, compare categories, and spot opportunities at a glance.
